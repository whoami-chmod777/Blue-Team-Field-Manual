Step 1: Install the server, client and plugin packages:
# apt-get install openvas-server openvas-client openvas-plugins-base openvas-plugins-dfsg

# openvas-nvt-sync

Step 3: Add a user to run the client:
# openvas-adduser

Step 8: type ctrl-D to exit and then accept.

Step 9: Start the server:
# service openvas-server start

Step 10: Set targets to scan:
Create a text file with a list of hosts/networks to scan.
# vi scanme.txt

Step 11: Add one host, network per line:
<IP ADDRESS OR RANGE>

Step 12: Run scan:
# openvas-client -q 127.0.0.1 9390 sysadm nsrc+ws scanme.txt openvas-output-.html -T txt -V -x

Step 13: (Optional)run scan with HTML format:
# openvas-client -q 127.0.0.1 9390 sysadm nsrc+ws scanme.txt openvas-output.txt -T html -V -x
